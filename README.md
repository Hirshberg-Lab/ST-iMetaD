This repository provides example input files for the simulations reported in "Short-Time Infrequent Metadynamics for Improved Kinetics Inference" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14237). 
In addition, the tutorial directory provides a Python file implementing the ST-iMetaD inference scheme and a tutorial jupyter notebook.
