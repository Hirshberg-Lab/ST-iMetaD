This repository provides example input files for the simulations reported in the above paper. 
In addition, the tutorial directory provides a Python file implementing the ST-iMetaD inference scheme and a tutorial jupyter notebook, as well as source data for the figures.

We note that there is an error in the labels of Figure 5c of the paper: the correct units are nanoseconds, and not microsecond as written.
